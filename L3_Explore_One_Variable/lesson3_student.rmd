Lesson 3
========================================================

***

### What to Do First?
Notes:
Load the data
***

### Pseudo-Facebook User Data
Notes:

```{r Pseudo-Facebook User Data}
getwd()
setwd("C:/learning/Udacity/Data Analysis with R/L3_Explore_One_Variable")
list.files()
pf <- read.csv("pseudo_facebook.tsv", sep = '\t')
names(pf)
```

***

### Histogram of Users' Birthdays
Notes:

```{r Histogram of Users\' Birthdays}

library(ggplot2)
names(pf)

library(ggthemes) 
theme_set(theme_minimal(24))
qplot(x = dob_day, data=pf)+scale_x_discrete(breaks=1:31)
```

***

#### What are some things that you notice about this histogram?
Response:
- Most of the people seems to have taken birth on day 1 which seem unusual
- 31st seems to be low as all months might not have 31 days
***

### Moira's Investigation
Notes:
- How a person who posted a facebook post, thinks how many people actually saw the post vs how many actually see the post
***

### Estimating Your Audience Size
Notes:
- 10 people might see my post
- 50% might see the post
***

#### Think about a time when you posted a specific message or shared a photo on Facebook. What was it?
Response:
few liks
#### How many of your friends do you think saw that post?
Response:
10
#### Think about what percent of your friends on Facebook see any posts or comments that you make in a month. What percent do you think that is?
Response:
5%
***

### Perceived Audience Size
Notes:
10
***
### Faceting
Notes:

```{r Faceting}
qplot(x = dob_day, data=pf)+scale_x_discrete(breaks=1:31)+facet_wrap(~dob_month, ncol=3)
```

#### Let’s take another look at our plot. What stands out to you here?
Response:
- 1st day of January has high number of dob_day
***

### Be Skeptical - Outliers and Anomalies
Notes:
- Jan 1st could be because facebook uses default as jan 1st.
***

### Moira's Outlier
Notes:
- Most people guessed smaller number, 1 personal guessd million people
#### Which case do you think applies to Moira’s outlier?
Response:
- bad data abour an extreme case
***

### Friend Count
Notes:

#### What code would you enter to create a histogram of friend counts?

```{r Friend Count}
names(pf)
qplot(x = friend_count, data= pf)
```

#### How is this plot similar to Moira's first plot?
Response:
- lot of users have 0 as friend count and we are uable to see the users who have more friends
***

### Limiting the Axes
Notes:

```{r Limiting the Axes}
qplot(x = friend_count, data= pf, xlim=c(0,1000))
qplot(x = friend_count, data= pf)+scale_x_continuous(limits=c(0,1000))
```

### Exploring with Bin Width
Notes:
using bin width helps to see the data clearly
***

### Adjusting the Bin Width
Notes:
Adjusting bin width moira was able to read the data in details.
### Faceting Friend Count
```{r Faceting Friend Count}
# What code would you add to create a facet the histogram by gender?
# Add it to the code below.
qplot(x = friend_count, data = pf, binwidth = 10) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 1000),
                     breaks = seq(0, 1000, 50))
```

***

### Omitting NA Values
Notes:

```{r Omitting NA Values}
qplot(x = friend_count, data = na.omit(pf), binwidth = 10) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 1000),
                     breaks = seq(0, 1000, 50))
```

***

### Statistics 'by' Gender
Notes:

```{r Statistics \'by\' Gender}
qplot(x = friend_count, data = subset(pf, !is.na(gender)), binwidth = 10) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 1000),
                     breaks = seq(0, 1000, 50))+facet_wrap(~gender)

```

#### Who on average has more friends: men or women?
Response:
table(pf$gender)
by(pf$friend_count, pf$gender, summary)
women

#### What's the difference between the median friend count for women and men?
Response:
22
#### Why would the median be a better measure than the mean?
Response:
Because number of male and female is different if they were same then mean would have probably made more sense.
Mean is more robust statistic
***

### Tenure
Notes:

```{r Tenure}
qplot(x=tenure, data=pf, binwidth=30, color=I('black'), fill=I('#099DD9'))
```

***

#### How would you create a histogram of tenure by year?

```{r Tenure Histogram by Year}
qplot(x=tenure/365, data=pf, binwidth=0.25, color=I('black'), xlab='Number of years using Facebook', ylab='Number of users in sample', fill=I('#F79420'))+scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1,7,1), limits=c(0,7))
```

***

### Labeling Plots
Notes:

```{r Labeling Plots}

qplot(x=tenure/365, data=pf, binwidth=0.25, color=I('black'), fill=I('#F79420'))+scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1,7,1), limits=c(0,7))
```

***

### User Ages
Notes:

```{r User Ages}
qplot(x=age, data=pf,binwidth=1, color=I('black'), fill=I('#F56440'))+scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(13,113,5), limits=c(13,113))
```

#### What do you notice?
Response:
Most of the users in the age from 15-35.
***

### The Spread of Memes
Notes:
histogram is used see the spread of meme
***

### Lada's Money Bag Meme
Notes:
using histogram
***

### Transforming Data
Notes:
- apply log or sqrt to tranform the data
***

### Add a Scaling Layer
Notes:

```{r Add a Scaling Layer}

library("gridExtra")

p1 = qplot(x = friend_count, data = na.omit(pf), binwidth = 10) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 1000),
                     breaks = seq(0, 1000, 50))

p2 = qplot(x = friend_count, data = na.omit(pf), binwidth =0.05) +
  scale_x_log10()

p3 = qplot(x = friend_count, data = na.omit(pf), binwidth =2) +
  scale_x_sqrt()

grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3)

```

***


### Frequency Polygons

```{r Frequency Polygons}
qplot(x=friend_count,y=..count../sum(..count..), data = subset(pf, !is.na(gender)), xlab='Friend Count', ylab='Proportion of Users with that friend count',binwidth=10, geom='freqpoly', color=gender)+scale_x_continuous(lim=c(0,1000), breaks=seq(0,1000,50))
```

***

### Likes on the Web
Notes:

```{r Likes on the Web}

by(pf$www_likes, pf$gender, sum)

qplot(x=www_likes, data = subset(pf, !is.na(gender)), geom='freqpoly', color=gender)+scale_x_continuous()+scale_x_log10()

```


***

### Box Plots
Notes:

```{r Box Plots}
qplot(x=gender, y=friend_count, 
      data = subset(pf, !is.na(gender)), 
      geom='boxplot')+ coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0,5000))
```

#### Adjust the code to focus on users who have friend counts between 0 and 1000.

```{r}
qplot(x=gender, y=friend_count, 
      data = subset(pf, !is.na(gender)), 
      geom='boxplot')+ coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0,1000))
```

***

### Box Plots, Quartiles, and Friendships
Notes:

```{r Box Plots, Quartiles, and Friendships}
names(pf)
qplot(x=gender, y=friendships_initiated, 
      data = subset(pf, !is.na(gender)), 
      geom='boxplot')+ coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0,150))
by(pf$friendships_initiated, pf$gender, summary)
```

#### On average, who initiated more friendships in our sample: men or women?
Response:
Women
#### Write about some ways that you can verify your answer.
Response:
```{r Friend Requests by Gender}
names(pf)
qplot(x=gender, y=friendships_initiated, 
      data = subset(pf, !is.na(gender)), 
      geom='boxplot')+ coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0,150))
by(pf$friendships_initiated, pf$gender, summary)
```

Response:
- Lookint at median, 1st quartile, 3rd quartile data for both genders, female has more requests initiated.
***

### Getting Logical
Notes:

```{r Getting Logical}
summary(pf$mobile_likes)
summary(pf$mobile_likes > 0) 

mobile_check_in <- NA
pf$mobile_check_in <- ifelse(pf$mobile_likes > 0, 1, 0)
pf$mobile_check_in <- factor(pf$mobile_check_in)
summary(pf$mobile_check_in)
mobile_check_in <- length(pf$mobile_likes > 0)
mobile_check_in
length(pf$mobile_likes)
percent <- sum(pf$mobile_check_in == 1) / length(pf$mobile_check_in)
percent

```

Response:
64.5

### Analyzing One Variable
Reflection:
- Learnt exploring one variable
- learnt how to use histogram, freqpoly and boxplot
- started following flowingdata.com by Nathan Yau
